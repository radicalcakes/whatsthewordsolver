A what's the word solver.
CLI for now, will be a web app.

2 input fields:

  - text input (a single string of all chars) -> size 11
  - int input (length of the word)

(Scraper) -> (Data Structure) -> (searching algo)

Possible DS :
- dict for words where word is key and val is length
O(n) to search for words with particular length
{4:["fuck", "luck", "suck"]}

- use the word as a t

- make web app

Algo:
instead of matching combinations of chars, 
take the len, narrow it down, and check each word's char
and see if char is in the user input
